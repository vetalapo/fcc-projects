                <p>“The most important thing is to say, he gave everything he had. Every performance, whether it was playing live onstage or just shaking hands with people. He made people feel special. It never was a job to him, it’s just him. That’s how he was. The music will live on forever. I think his legacy is pretty well known throughout the metal world and even the regular music world.”</p>
